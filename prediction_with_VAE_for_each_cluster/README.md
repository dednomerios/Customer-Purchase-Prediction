1- we have eliminated customers_id and group_id and used these features to add nother clustering based feature to the model. 
2- we can now adjust the treshhold in order to change the recall/ precision in our validaiton notebook 
3- we have now a single upsampling approach for each of the twp clusters. 
4- Working with and creating dataframes are now a lot easier according to a particulat datastet
